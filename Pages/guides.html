                  <strong>What to bring:</strong>
                  <p> If you're traveling internationally to Paris there are a few necessities for a good vacation! France uses type E power sockets, so make sure you have the right
                    adapters for your devices! It might also be beneficial to bring a French phrasebook or have a language app handy on your smartphone. Speaking of a smartphone, if you
                    are worried about losing your documents, keep a copy of them separate from the originals in case of loss or theft. Finally, it never hurts to have a map handy!
