                    New York offers a wide range of experiences depending on
                    what season you visit! During the spring the city parks are

                    outdoor attractions like Central Park and Coney Island!
                    During the fall the foliage in the city's parks becomes
                    beautifully colored, especially in Central Park! And during
                    the winter you will see iconic events and decorations, like
                    the Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree

                  <p>
                    The most common time to visit Paris is during the summer,
                    which brings large crowds and higher prices. If those don't
                    seem too appealing to you, don't worry! The spring and the
                    fall are some of the best times to visit Paris! During the
                    spring you can expect warmer weather and blooming wildlife.
                    You can also expect to see various outdoor concerts and
                    festivals! During the fall you can expect cooler, crisp
                    weather. The Luxembourg Gardens are beautiful this time of
                    year. The fall also has various events including Paris
                    Fashion Week and the Nuit Blanche art festival!
                  </p>

                  <strong>What to bring:</strong>
                  <p>
                    If you're traveling internationally to Paris there are a few
                    necessities for a good vacation! France uses type E power
                    sockets, so make sure you have the right adapters for your
                    devices! It might also be beneficial to bring a French
                    phrasebook or have a language app handy on your smartphone.
                    Speaking of a smartphone, if you are worried about losing
                    your documents, keep a copy of them separate from the
                    originals in case of loss or theft. Finally, it never hurts
                    to have a map handy!

                  <p>
                    The best time to visit Stockholm is in the summer or spring
                    (April to August). Summer is ideal for exploring outdoor
                    attractions and enjoying festivals and outdoor dining. In
                    the summer there are also several ferrys that can take you
                    to the small islands in the archipelago. Spring and autumn
                    offer mild temperatures, perfect for city strolls. Winter
                    (November to March) can be cold and snowy, but it's a
                    magical time to experience Swedish traditions like ice
                    skating, Christmas markets, and cozy candlelit cafes.

                  <strong>What to bring:</strong>
                  <p>
                    Sweden uses type E power sockets, so make sure you have the
                    right adapters for your devices! Cash is not King in Sweden,
                    so you don't need to bother about bringing cash. If you are
                    visiting in winter, you need to bring a warm jacket, hat and
                    gloves. An umbrella and a resuable bag is also recommended.

                    Melbourne experiences four distinct seasons. Spring
                    (September to November) and Autumn (March to May) are
                    particularly pleasant with mild temperatures and colorful
                    foliage. Summer (December to February) can get hot, but it's
                    great for outdoor activities and festivals. Winter (June to
                    August) can be chilly, but indoor attractions and cozy cafes
                    thrive during this time.

                    Make sure to bring comfortable walking shoes and layers of
                    clothing, suitable for Melbourne's changeable weather. If
                    you are visiting in summer, it can be good to bring a
                    reusable water bottle, sunscreen and sunglasses. If you are
                    going in spring or autumn, an umbrella or rain jacket is
                    recomended. A must to bring is a camera or smartphone to
                    capture all the vibrant street art and scenic landscapes.
